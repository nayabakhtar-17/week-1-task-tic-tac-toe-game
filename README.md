DESCRIPCTION:

"Tic Tac Toe is a classic game of strategy and skill, implemented in C++ as a console application. The game allows two players, X and O, to take turns placing symbols on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. The C++ implementation uses a simple text-based interface, with functions for handling player input, updating the game board, and determining the winner. The game also includes basic error handling and validation to ensure a smooth gameplay experience."
